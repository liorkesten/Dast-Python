# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Implementain of Data structures and algorithms.
Most of the code implemented in Python excpet 2 data structures:
1. C - Red Black Tree.
2. Java - Hash Set.

Also you can find a table (excel file) that contains most of the data structures and algorithms with their specifc API, time complexity and space complexity.

# DS:
1. Heap, Max Heap, Min Heap
2. Doubly LinkedList
3. Queue
4. Stack
5. Graph.
6. RB Tree
7. BST Tree
8. HashSet
9. Union-Find
10. Range Array.

# Algorithms:
1. String algorithms.
2. Array algorithms.
3. Sort algorithms:
  3.1 MergeSort.
  3.2 QuickSort.
  3.3 Insertion Sort.
  3.4 Heap Sort.
  3.5 Selection Sort.
  3.6 Bin Sort.
  3.7 Counting Sort.
4. MST algorithms.
5. Graph algorithms:
  5.1 BFS
  5.2 Check for cycle
  5.3 Check if the graph is bipartite
  5.4 Couting num of connected components
6. BST algorithms:
  6.1 LCA.
7. Binary representation algorithms.
